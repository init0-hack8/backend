                üìù POST CONTEXT:

                - **Keywords**: Valentine's Day, love, celebration, NVIDIA
                - **Tone**: Joyful, Affectionate
                - **Category**: Entertainment
                - **Emotional Depth**: 3/5

                healthcare related posts are good for older people or newborn baby!
                ---
                Ensure the analysis considers **seasonal and current relevance**. For example, a Valentine's Day post in February is timely, but one in July is not. If the post is **not relevant to current trends**, explain that briefly.
                Your task is to extract and return detailed, structured insights about audience reactions, engagement styles, and platform-specific patterns based on the above context.
